# doc-build-system (`dbs`)

## Overview

What is `dbs`? It is another way to write and organize a document. Its
meant to be written in plain-text Markdown language. The organization
of multiple Markdown files should be looking like a source code is
organized.
There will be an index file, which will be the starting point of the
document build. From there all other files can be accessed.

## Motivation

It might be, that this 'system' is nothing new at all. I don't
care. I have an idea and I will write it down. The later use-case will
be the writing of my bachelor thesis, but the general use-cases are
document setups in all styles.
